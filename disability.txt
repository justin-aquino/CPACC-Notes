MEDICAL MODEL - basically views disability as a problem of the person, and that the person is responsible 
for finding a solution to any barriers they encounter, caused by their disability.

    Strengths: The medical model can address the biological sources of disabilities, either by clinically curing them, or providing ways to medically
                manage the conditions. The medical component of disabilities is a critical reality for many people.

    Weaknesses: The medical model treats disability as a problem or inherent characteristic of the individual, and seeks a cure or medical
                management of a bodily condition, often over looking the broader sociopolitical constrainst imposed by unwelcoming or inaccessible
                environments.

    Example:
            - A person in a wheelchair is unable to get into a building because the only way to access it is by using steps.
            - A person who has red-green color-blindness cannot tell the status of their project in the company's online project portfolio,
                because the status is indicated in red and green instead of being indicated by text labels.
            - Someone who is hard of hearing and attending a local government meeting in a large room cannot understand everything the mayor 
                is saying because the mayor is speaking without a microphone.

SOCIAL MODEL - Social model of disability sees the issue of disabilit as a socially created problem.
            - The social model of disability sees the issue of 'disability' as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society.
            - In this model, disability is not an attribtue of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment.
